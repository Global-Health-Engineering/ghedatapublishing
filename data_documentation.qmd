# Documenting your dataset {#sec-datadocumentation}

## Setting Up and Writing Documentation with Roxygen

### Initialize Roxygen Documentation
- Open your R console within your project.
- Execute the following command:
  ```r
  setup_roxygen()
  ```
- This command will create documentation files in the `R/` folder of your project.

### Write Documentation
- Navigate to the `R/` folder in your project.
- Open each documentation file (they will have a `.R` extension).
- For each file, write a human-readable title and description about the dataset.
- Use Roxygen comments (starting with #') to document your data. For example:
  ```r
  #' Title of Your Dataset
  #'
  #' A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
  #'
  #' @format A data frame with X rows and Y columns:
  #' \describe{
  #'   \item{column1}{Description of column1}
  #'   \item{column2}{Description of column2}
  #'   ...
  #' }
  #' @source Where the data comes from (if applicable)
  "dataset_name"
  ```

### Update GitHub Repository
- In RStudio, go to the "Git" tab.
- Stage all changed files by checking the boxes next to them.
- Click "Commit".
- Write a meaningful commit message (e.g., "Add Roxygen documentation for dataset").
- Click "Push" to update your GitHub repository.

### Document, Check, and Install the Package
Run the following commands in the R console:
```r
devtools::document()
devtools::check()
devtools::install()
```
These commands will:
- Generate documentation from your Roxygen comments
- Check for any issues in your package
- Install the package locally

Note: You may see a warning about the license, which we'll address in the next section.

## Updating the DESCRIPTION File

### Add Yourself as Author
Run the following command in the R console, replacing the placeholders with your information:
```r
use_author(
  given = "Your First Name", 
  family = "Your Last Name", 
  role = c("aut", "cre"), 
  email = "your.email@example.com",
  comment = c(ORCID = "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX")
)
```
- `aut` means author
- `cre` means creator/maintainer

### Document Other Contributors
- Go to your GitHub repository.
- Create a new issue titled "Author Information for DESCRIPTION File".
- In the issue, list all contributors with their:
  - Full name
  - Email address
  - Role (`aut` for significant contributions, `ctb` for smaller contributions)
  - ORCID (if available)

### Add Additional Authors
For each additional author, run a command like this:
```r
use_author(given = "Coauthor First Name", family = "Coauthor Last Name", role = "aut")
```

### Update DESCRIPTION File
- Open the `DESCRIPTION` file in your project.
- Write an appropriate `Title` and `Description` for your package.
- In the R console, run:
  ```r
  update_description()
  ```
- This will update other fields in the DESCRIPTION file.
- Review the `DESCRIPTION` file to ensure all information is correct.

### Final Documentation and Check
Run these commands again:
```r
devtools::document()
devtools::check()
devtools::install()
```

This process ensures your package is well-documented and ready for use. If you encounter any errors or warnings during this process, don't hesitate to seek help. The R community is very supportive, and many resources are available online to troubleshoot common issues.
