    "text": "Welcome\nPublishing data can be challenging, especially when adhering to standards of reproducibility. Although technically available, an Excel workbook with multiple tabs, tucked away in an online archive, is far from practical. In other words, it lacks the key principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible — commonly known as FAIR.\nThis guide aims to provide a detailed walkthrough of how data can be published according to the FAIR principles. It builds on washr, an R package developed for swift data publication. The package emerged from the need to streamline certain steps when publishing the datasets collected during GHE’s openwashdata academy.\nThe guide follows a chronological structure, starting from an empty repository and resulting in the publication of data as a website. 1  Creating a repository introduces version control, guiding readers through setting up both local and remote repositories to track all development steps. 2  Preparing your dataset focuses on transforming the dataset into a tidy format. 3  Documenting Your Dataset covers the documentation of the tidy dataset. 4  Publishing Your Dataset explains how users can create a website to showcase their dataset. Finally, 5  Creating a DOI and connecting it to GitHub helps you create a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for your published data.\nThis book is a work in progress. As we publish more data, we learn more and these insights flow back into this book. If something is unclear or incomplete, please open an issue here and we’ll try to address it.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following steps assume that you are a member of GHE on GitHub. If you are not, reach out here so we can create a repository for you.\n\n\nAs your very first step, you have to create a new repository within the Global Health Engineering (hereafter referred to as GHE) organization on GitHub. You can do this here.\nChoose a name for your repository, make it public if you’re data is not confidential/sensitive and click on “Create repository”. For now, you don’t need a README, .gitignore file or a license. You’ll add these at a later stage.\nOnce the repository is initialized, go back to RStudio and check if the devtools and usethis packages are installed. If not, please install/update them now as some of their functions are needed in the next steps.\nNext, you have to create an R Project. Go to File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; R Package using devtools.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the name you chose for your GitHub repository as the directory name and select a location on your computer for your new project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the next steps, we assume that you’ve already configured Git on your computer. If not, please make sure to do that before proceeding.\n\n\nWith your project set up locally and a new repository online, it’s time to connect the two. To do this, switch to the Terminal (the tab next to Console in RStudio) and run the following commands one after the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nReplace REPO with the name of your newly created repository.\n\n\ngit remote add origin \"https://github.com/Global-Health-Engineering/REPO.git\" \n\ngit branch -M main\n\ngit push -u origin main\nIf everything went well, you’re local repository (on your computer) should now be connected to the remote repository (on GitHub) which allows you to push and pull changes and to invite collaborators.",

You can do this by clicking “Source” at the top of the editor window, or by selecting all the code and clicking “Run.” This will process your raw data and produce a tidy version of the dataset, ready for analysis.\nReturn to the “Git” tab in RStudio, where you should see your modified data_processing.R file, along with any new output files that may have been generated.

Focus on the “description” column: for each row representing a variable, provide a clear and concise description of what that variable represents.

For instance, you could use the following format to document your dataset:\n#' Title of Your Dataset\n#'\n#' A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.\n#'\n#' @format A data frame with X rows and Y columns:\n#' \\describe{\n#'   \\item{column1}{Description of column1}\n#'   \\item{column2}{Description of column2}\n#'   ...\n#' }\n#' @source Where the data comes from (if applicable)\n\"dataset_name\"\nThis method allows you to provide clear, concise details about each dataset, ensuring that users understand its structure and purpose.\n\n\n3.1.2 Updating Your GitHub Repository\nOnce you’ve completed the documentation, it’s time to update your GitHub repository. In RStudio, go to the “Git” tab. Stage all the changed files by checking the boxes next to them, then click “Commit”. Write a meaningful commit message, such as “Add Roxygen documentation for dataset”, and click “Push” to update your repository with the latest changes.\n\n\n3.1.3 Finalizing and Installing the Documentation\nNow that your documentation is written, run the following commands in your R console:\n\ndevtools::document()\ndevtools::check()\ndevtools::install()\n\nThese commands will generate the documentation from your Roxygen comments, check for any issues in the package, and install it locally.

List all contributors, including their full name, email address, role (e.g., aut for authors or ctb for contributors), and ORCID (if applicable).\nFor each additional contributor, run a similar command:\n\nuse_author(given = \"Coauthor First Name\", family = \"Coauthor Last Name\", role = \"aut\")\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Updating the DESCRIPTION File\nAfter adding all contributors, open the DESCRIPTION file in your project and ensure the title and description reflect the purpose of your package accurately.

Review the DESCRIPTION file to make sure all information is accurate.\n\n\n3.2.4 Final Documentation Check\nTo complete the process, run the following commands again:\n\ndevtools::document()\ndevtools::check()\ndevtools::install()\n\nThese steps will ensure your package is fully documented, checked for errors, and ready for use.",

Open the .gitignore file in your project directory, find the line that says docs, and remove it. Save the file to allow the docs/ folder to be tracked by Git.\n\n\n4.2.4 Updating GitHub with Website Files\nGo to the “Git” tab in RStudio.

Finally, click “Save.”\nYour package website will now be live at https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepositoryname/.\nRemember, if you make significant changes to your package or documentation, you may need to rebuild the website by running pkgdown::build_site() and pushing the updated docs/ folder to GitHub.",
