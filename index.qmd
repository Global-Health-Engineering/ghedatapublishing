# Hi! {.unnumbered}

This book is designed to simplify the publication of data at [Global Health Engineering](https://ghe.ethz.ch/) (GHE). It requires some familiarity with Git(Hub) and R(Studio), but is organised as a step-by-step guide to make the individual steps starting from an empty repository to publishing a data package with its own website website as easy as possible. 

This book is a work in progress. As we publish more data, we learn more and these insights flow back into this book. If something is unclear or incomplete, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Global-Health-Engineering/ghedatapublishing/issues) and we'll try to address it.
