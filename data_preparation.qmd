# Preparing your dataset {#sec-datapreparation}

## Setting Up Your Raw Data Directory

### Create a Directory for Raw Data
- Open your R console within your project.
- Type and execute the following command:

  ```r
  setup_rawdata()
  ```
  
- This command will create a new directory called `data-raw` in your project folder.

### Move Your Raw Data Files
- Locate your raw data files on your computer.
- Copy or move these files into the newly created `data-raw` directory.

### Update Your GitHub Repository
- In RStudio, locate the "Git" tab in the top-right panel.
- As a good practice, click "Pull" first to ensure you have the latest changes.
- In the Git tab, you'll see a list of changed files. Tick the checkboxes next to all the files you've added or modified.
- Click the "Commit" button.
- In the new window, enter a descriptive commit message explaining what you've added (e.g., "Add raw data files to data-raw directory").
- Finally, click the "Push" button to upload your changes to GitHub.

## Clean and Process Your Raw Data

### Edit the Data Processing Script
- Open the file `data-raw/data_processing.R` in your RStudio editor.
- This script is pre-populated with some code, but you'll need to modify it to suit your specific data cleaning needs.
- Add your own R code to clean and process your raw data files.
- Make sure your code reads the files from the `data-raw` directory and outputs a tidy version of your data.

### Run the Data Processing Script
- Once you've finished editing `data_processing.R`, run the entire script.
- You can do this by clicking "Source" at the top of the editor window, or by selecting all the code and clicking "Run".
- This will execute your data cleaning process and should result in a tidy version of your dataset.

### Update GitHub Again
- Return to the "Git" tab in RStudio.
- You should see your modified `data_processing.R` file and possibly new output files.
- Commit these changes with a meaningful commit message (e.g., "Clean and process raw data").
- Push your changes to GitHub.

## Creating a Data Dictionary

### Set Up the Dictionary Template
- In your R console, execute the following command:

  ```r
  setup_dictionary()
  ```
  
- This will create a new file called `dictionary.csv` in your `data-raw` directory.

### Fill in the Data Dictionary
- Open `data-raw/dictionary.csv` in a spreadsheet program like Excel or in RStudio's data viewer.
- You'll see columns for each dataset and variable in your tidy data.
- Focus on the "description" column:
  - For each row (representing a variable), provide a clear and concise description of what that variable represents.
  - Include information like units of measurement, possible values, or any other relevant details.
- Save your changes to `dictionary.csv`.

### Update GitHub with Your Data Dictionary
- Once again, go to the "Git" tab in RStudio.
- You should see the modified `dictionary.csv` file.
- Commit these changes with a message like "Add data dictionary".
- Push your changes to GitHub.

## Final Check
- Review your GitHub repository online to ensure all your changes have been uploaded correctly.
- You should now have:
  - A `data-raw` directory with your original data files
  - A `data_processing.R` script that cleans your data
  - A `dictionary.csv` file describing your tidy dataset

Congratulations! You've now prepared your dataset and created a data dictionary, all while maintaining version control with Git and GitHub.
